# Generative & Agentic AI — Hands-On Exercises

*Companion repository for the exercise sessions of* **Aktuelle Fallstudien der Digitalökonomie und der Künstlichen Intelligenz: Generative und Agentische KI**.

Lecture theory is delivered via slides in class. This repository is the hands-on practice companion: a small, working multi-agent AI system built with [CrewAI](https://crewai.com) that you'll read, run, and extend across the exercise sessions — plus a graded team assignment where you design your own agentic AI architecture for a use case of your choice.

## Goal

The goal of these exercises is to turn the architectural concepts from the lecture — agents, tasks, tools, RAG, multi-agent orchestration, trust, production, security — from slides into things you've actually read, run, and modified in working code. By the end, you'll be able to **design**, and optionally **implement**, your own agentic AI architecture for a real use case, using CrewAI as the concrete framework.

## Intro to CrewAI

[CrewAI](https://docs.crewai.com) is a Python framework for orchestrating multiple LLM-powered agents that collaborate on a shared set of tasks, instead of one model trying to do everything in a single call. Four abstractions do all the work:

- **Agent** — a `role`, `goal`, `backstory`, an LLM, and optionally `tools`
- **Task** — a `description`, an `expected_output`, and which agent is assigned to it
- **Crew** — the collection of agents + tasks + a `process` for running them
- **Process** — the orchestration strategy: `sequential` (fixed pipeline) or `hierarchical` (a manager agent delegates dynamically)

CrewAI's signature choice — covered in depth in [exercise 02](exercises/en/02-agentic-frameworks.md) — is that `role`/`goal`/`backstory`/task definitions live in **YAML config**, not Python, so you can usually change *what* a crew does without touching the orchestration code at all.

## The template code

This repo's working crew (`researcher` → `analyst`, sequential) is the running example for every exercise:

| File | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| [src/research_crew/crew.py](src/research_crew/crew.py) | Defines the agents, tasks, and the `Crew` itself — short on purpose |
| [src/research_crew/config/agents.yaml](src/research_crew/config/agents.yaml) | Each agent's `role`/`goal`/`backstory` |
| [src/research_crew/config/tasks.yaml](src/research_crew/config/tasks.yaml) | Each task's `description`/`expected_output`/agent assignment |
| [src/research_crew/main.py](src/research_crew/main.py) | Entry point — sets the `topic` input and kicks off the crew |
| [src/research_crew/tools/custom_tool.py](src/research_crew/tools/custom_tool.py) | An unwired template for writing your own tool (exercise 04) |

## Use cases to pick from

For the team assignment (see below), you design your own crew for a topic of your choice. All ten ideas need **zero structural changes** to get started — only the `topic` string — because the researcher/analyst roles are already topic-agnostic. Pick one, or propose your own:

| # | Use case | Example topic | Natural tool to add | Natural RAG source to add |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Competitive landscape analysis | "Competitive landscape for [industry]" | Web search / scraping | Market-positioning brief (PDF) |
| 2 | Regulatory impact briefing | "EU AI Act impact on SaaS startups" | Web search | The regulation text itself |
| 3 | Academic literature review | "Recent advances in [CS/AI subtopic]" | `ArxivPaperTool` | A seminal paper's PDF |
| 4 | Job market & skills trend report | "In-demand skills for [tech field]" | Web search / job search tool | A skills-framework doc |
| 5 | Startup due-diligence memo | "Due diligence on [startup]" | Web search | The startup's pitch deck (PDF) |
| 6 | Personalized travel planner | "Travel plan for [destination]" | Web search | Reuse `knowledge/user_preference.txt` |
| 7 | Product sentiment synthesis | "Customer sentiment on [product category]" | Web search / scraping | The product's FAQ/support docs |
| 8 | ESG/sustainability risk briefing | "ESG risks for [company/sector]" | Web search | The company's sustainability report |
| 9 | Personal finance topic explainer | "ETFs vs. individual stocks" | Web search | A fund prospectus or glossary |
| 10 | News digest on an ongoing story | "Weekly digest on [news topic]" | Web search / news search tool | A backgrounder doc |

Full detail (why each is low-friction, and exactly what changes at each milestone) is in [exercises/en/assignment-milestones.md](exercises/en/assignment-milestones.md).

## Getting started — choose one option

There are two independent ways to get this project running. Pick **one**:

- **Option A — GitHub Codespaces:** run entirely in the browser, nothing installed on your machine.
- **Option B — Run locally:** clone the repo and run it with Python/uv on your own computer.

Both options end up running the exact same code; only the setup step differs. Everything below "Run the crew" applies regardless of which option you picked.

### Option A: GitHub Codespaces (no local install)

No local install needed.

**If you want to edit and save your own changes** (e.g. for an assignment), fork this repo first, then open the Codespace from your fork: **Code → Create codespace on master** on *your fork's* page. You won't have push access if you open a Codespace directly on the original repo.

The container automatically installs `uv` and runs `uv sync`.

**Add your API keys via Codespaces secrets (recommended — do this before opening your first codespace):** go to [github.com/settings/codespaces](https://github.com/settings/codespaces) → Codespaces secrets → add `GROQ_API_KEY` and `SERPER_API_KEY`. They'll be available as environment variables automatically in every codespace you open, on this repo or your fork — no file to create or edit inside the codespace at all. (`GEMINI_API_KEY` is only needed if you do the RAG/memory exercises, which use Gemini for embeddings.)

<details>
<summary>Alternative: local <code>.env</code> file inside the codespace (only if you can't use Codespaces secrets)</summary>

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` inside the codespace and fill in your keys — **edit `.env`, not `.env.example`** (the latter is the committed template and stays empty; real keys belong only in `.env`, which is gitignored).
</details>

Once that's done, skip ahead to [Run the crew](#run-the-crew) below.

### Option B: Run locally

Ensure you have Python >=3.10 <3.14 installed on your system. This project uses [UV](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for dependency management and package handling, offering a seamless setup and execution experience.

First, if you haven't already, install uv:

```bash
pip install uv
```

Clone the repo, then from its root install the dependencies:

```bash
uv sync
```

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your `GROQ_API_KEY` and `SERPER_API_KEY` (and `GEMINI_API_KEY` if you'll do the RAG/memory exercises, which use Gemini for embeddings).

Once that's done, continue with [Run the crew](#run-the-crew) below.

### Customizing

**Make sure your `.env` has the right API keys for whichever LLM/tools you use**

- Modify `src/research_crew/config/agents.yaml` to define your agents
- Modify `src/research_crew/config/tasks.yaml` to define your tasks
- Modify `src/research_crew/crew.py` to add your own logic, tools and specific args
- Modify `src/research_crew/main.py` to add custom inputs for your agents and tasks

## Run the crew

This applies whether you set up via Codespaces or locally. From the project root:

```bash
uv run research_crew
```

This initializes the research_crew Crew, assembling the agents and assigning them tasks as defined in your configuration, and saves the report to `output/report.md`.

## Live demo UI (Streamlit)

For a classroom-friendly view of the agents working, run the Streamlit app instead of the plain CLI. It shows each agent/task/tool event live in the browser, then renders the final report.

```bash
uv run streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

Locally this opens at `http://localhost:8501`. In a Codespace, port `8501` is auto-forwarded and a preview tab opens automatically (configured in `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`).

## Exercise sessions

15 exercise sessions ([English](exercises/README.md) / [Deutsch](exercises/de/README.md)) cover agent concepts, tools, RAG, multi-agent patterns, production, and security. Every session has the same two-part shape:

- **Part 1 — Theory**: the concept and its seminal paper/book, with a reproduced figure where one exists
- **Part 2 — Practice**: exactly where that concept already shows up in this repo's code, plus a hands-on task and an optional stretch goal

## Team assignment

Alongside the exercise sessions, teams design their own crew for a use case of their choice (see the table above), growing it in complexity milestone-by-milestone as new sessions unlock new capabilities — a critical risk/constraint analysis is the main graded deliverable, working code is an optional bonus. Start at [exercises/en/assignment-overview.md](exercises/en/assignment-overview.md) (English / [Deutsch](exercises/de/assignment-overview.md)).

## Adding more tools or RAG (for students)

`crewai_tools` ships ~90 built-in tools beyond `SerperDevTool`. The setup that matters most is whether a tool calls an external API directly (just needs a key) or does **local embedding-based search** (needs an embedder pointed at Gemini, same as below) — that split is called out per category.

| Category | Needs embedder config? | Tools |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Web search | No — just an API key | `SerperDevTool`, `TavilySearchTool`, `BraveSearchTool`, `EXASearchTool`, `SerpApiGoogleSearchTool`, `SerpApiGoogleShoppingTool`, `SerplyWebSearchTool`, `SerplyNewsSearchTool`, `SerplyJobSearchTool`, `SerplyScholarSearchTool`, `LinkupSearchTool`, `ParallelSearchTool`, `ArxivPaperTool`, `FirecrawlSearchTool` |
| Web scraping & browser automation | No — just an API key | `ScrapeWebsiteTool`, `ScrapeElementFromWebsiteTool`, `SerperScrapeWebsiteTool`, `SerplyWebpageToMarkdownTool`, `FirecrawlScrapeWebsiteTool`, `FirecrawlCrawlWebsiteTool`, `JinaScrapeWebsiteTool`, `ScrapflyScrapeWebsiteTool`, `ScrapegraphScrapeTool`, `SeleniumScrapingTool`, `SpiderTool`, `BrowserbaseLoadTool`, `HyperbrowserLoadTool`, `StagehandTool`, `MultiOnTool`, `TavilyExtractorTool`, `BrightDataSearchTool`, `BrightDataWebUnlockerTool`, `BrightDataDatasetTool`, `OxylabsAmazonProductScraperTool`, `OxylabsAmazonSearchScraperTool`, `OxylabsGoogleSearchScraperTool`, `OxylabsUniversalScraperTool` |
| Local RAG / semantic content search | **Yes** — defaults to OpenAI embeddings | `RagTool` (base class), `WebsiteSearchTool`, `PDFSearchTool`, `CSVSearchTool`, `DOCXSearchTool`, `JSONSearchTool`, `MDXSearchTool`, `TXTSearchTool`, `XMLSearchTool`, `CodeDocsSearchTool`, `GithubSearchTool`, `YoutubeVideoSearchTool`, `YoutubeChannelSearchTool`, `DirectorySearchTool` |
| Vector database connectors | Bring your own embeddings/index | `QdrantVectorSearchTool`, `WeaviateVectorSearchTool`, `MongoDBVectorSearchTool`, `CouchbaseFTSVectorSearchTool` |
| Databases & structured data | No | `MySQLSearchTool`, `SnowflakeSearchTool`, `SingleStoreSearchTool`, `DatabricksQueryTool`, `NL2SQLTool` |
| File & storage I/O | No | `FileReadTool`, `FileWriterTool`, `FileCompressorTool`, `DirectoryReadTool`, `S3ReaderTool`, `S3WriterTool` |
| Code execution | No | `CodeInterpreterTool` |
| Vision, image & OCR | No | `DallETool`, `VisionTool`, `OCRTool` |
| Evaluation & quality | No | `PatronusEvalTool`, `PatronusLocalEvaluatorTool`, `PatronusPredefinedCriteriaEvalTool` |
| Platform & automation integrations | Varies by platform | `ZapierActionTool`, `ComposioTool`, `ApifyActorsTool`, `EnterpriseActionTool`, `MergeAgentHandlerTool`, `GenerateCrewaiAutomationTool`, `InvokeCrewAIAutomationTool`, `BedrockInvokeAgentTool`, `BedrockKBRetrieverTool`, `AIMindTool`, `LlamaIndexTool`, `ContextualAICreateAgentTool`, `ContextualAIParseTool`, `ContextualAIQueryTool`, `ContextualAIRerankTool` |

For any tool marked "Needs embedder config", point it at Gemini the same way (otherwise it fails with a missing `OPENAI_API_KEY` error, even though the crew's chat LLM is Groq):

```python
WebsiteSearchTool(config={
    "embedding_model": {
        "provider": "google-generativeai",
        "config": {"api_key": os.getenv("GEMINI_API_KEY"), "model_name": "gemini-embedding-001"},
    },
})
```

This crew's `embedder` (see `crew.py`) is already configured the same way at the `Crew` level, so adding a `knowledge_sources=[...]` list there (e.g. a `TextFileKnowledgeSource` pointing at `knowledge/user_preference.txt`) will embed via Gemini automatically — that wiring is left as a hands-on task in exercise 05.
