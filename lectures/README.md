# Aktuelle Fallstudien der Digitalökonomie und der Künstlichen Intelligenz: Generative und Agentische KI

🇬🇧 **English** (this page) · 🇩🇪 [Deutsch](de/README.md)

This series teaches agentic AI concepts using this repository as the running example. It follows the structure of Microsoft's [AI Agents for Beginners](https://github.com/microsoft/ai-agents-for-beginners) course, adapted to CrewAI and grounded entirely in this project's code instead of abstract examples.

Every lecture has the same shape:
- **Concept** — what the idea is and why it matters
- **In this repo** — exactly where that concept already shows up in `research_crew`, with file/line references
- **Exercise** — something students implement or modify themselves
- **Stretch goal** (optional) — a harder follow-up for students who finish early

Students should have [Run the crew](../README.md#run-the-crew) working (via Codespaces or locally) before lecture 1.

Not covered: the source course's "Microsoft Agent Framework" and "Browser-use / Computer Use Agents" modules are framework-specific to tools outside CrewAI's scope and are intentionally omitted.

## For instructors

Each exercise references real files in `src/research_crew/`. Have students work directly in their own Codespace or fork — see the main [README](../README.md) for the two setup options. Solutions aren't included on purpose; if you want a reference implementation for grading, ask students to open a PR against their own fork so you can review the diff.
